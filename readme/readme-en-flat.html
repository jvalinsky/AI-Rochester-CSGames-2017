<p>Welcome to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Here, chess is obsolete; therefore, people started playing a new kind of 1 vs 1 game...</p>
<p>It's called paper hockey.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="paper-hockey">Paper Hockey</h1>
<p>Paper Hockey is a turn-based game played on a <code>11x11</code> grid.</p>
<p>The game starts with a puck at the center of the grid, and the goal of the game is to take the puck into your opponent's net.</p>
<p>Goals are at the north and south boundaries of the grid (see the picture below).</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="rules">Rules:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each turn, a player can throw the puck in one of 8 directions (N, S, W, E and diagonals)</li>
<li>The puck can't travel twice on the same segment - once the ice is crushed you can't go back.</li>
<li>Shooting the puck into a visited node or a wall results in a bounce, which allows the active player to make another move.</li>
<li>You have at most 2 seconds to send your move. Timing out means losing the game.</li>
<li>A game is won by scoring a goal or forcing the other player into checkmate (see <code>Checkmate</code> section).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="goal-example">Goal example</h2>
<ol>
<li>Player 1 (green) moves north (towards his goal):</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/one.png" width="300" alt="Green north"/></p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>Player 2 (red) moves north east (a dumb move):</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/two.png" width="300" alt="Green north, Red north east"/></p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>Player 1 (green) moves north.</li>
<li>Player 2 (red) moves north west.</li>
<li>Player 1 (green) moves north west, hitting a wall, resulting in a <strong>bounce</strong>.</li>
<li>Player 1 (green) moves north east, scoring a <strong>goal</strong> and winning the game.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/won.png" width="300" alt="Green north, Red north east, Green north, Red north west, Green north west, Green north east"></p>
<p>Here is the replay of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>P1 - north</li>
<li>P2 - north east</li>
<li>P1 - north</li>
<li>P2 - north west</li>
<li>P1 - north west [bounce]</li>
<li>P1 - north east</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="epic-bouncing-example">Epic bouncing example</h2>
<p>Imagine the following players drawing a pine by moving the puck around:</p>
<p><img src="images/pine.gif" width="300"/></p>
<hr />
<p>Player 2 now has the opportunity to end the game in a single turn by bouncing against visited nodes and the wall:</p>
<p><img src="images/pine_wild.gif" width="300"/></p>
<p>One could only wish the Montreal Canadiens had this kind of offensive skills!</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="checkmate-example">Checkmate example</h2>
<p>In this game, player one just moved into a wall and has to play again (bouncing). Because all the segments out of the current node are crushed, player one cannot issue a valid move and loses by checkmate.</p>
<p><img src="images/check.gif" width="300" alt="Green north west, Red north west, Green north west, Red north west, Green north west"/></p>
<hr />
<p>This is another checkmate example where player one loses.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>To play the game, you must connect to localhost:8023.<br />
The protocol is text-based - you can even play from telnet!</p>
<p>Once connected, the first thing you'll receive is:</p>
<pre><code>What&#39;s your name?</code></pre>
<p>You should reply with your team name, and receive this confirmation:</p>
<pre><code>Welcome, Bob you&#39;re player 0!</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Once both players have entered their name, they will receive information about the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>position of the ball</li>
<li>where is your goal</li>
<li><p>{player_name} is active player [only if it's your turn]</p>
<pre><code>Game is on - 1
ball is at (5, 5) - 3
your goal is north - 5
Bob is active player - 7</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="moves">Moves</h3>
<p>When you're the active player, you can send one of the following moves:</p>
<pre><code>north
north east
east
south east
south
south west
west
north west</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Once a valid move is issued, Player 1 (aka Bob) will receive:</p>
<pre><code>south
Bob did go south - 9</code></pre>
<p>and P2 (aka Malory) will receive:</p>
<pre><code>Bob did go south - 8
Malory is active player - 10</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="bouncing">Bouncing</h3>
<p>Bouncing player will be informed by the statement &quot;{player_name} is active player&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>Bob did go north west - 15
Malory is active player - 17
east
Malory did go east - 18
Malory is active player - 20
east
Malory did go east - 22</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="invalid-move">Invalid move</h3>
<p>If Malory tries to go north now, she'll receive &quot;invalid move&quot;.</p>
<p>Bob won't be notified of invalid moves.</p>
<pre><code>Bob did go south - 8
Malory is active player - 10
invalid move - 11</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>If you send an action when it's not your turn, you'll receive:</p>
<pre><code>ignoring action south - 20</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="winning-the-game">Winning the game</h3>
<p>Here is the output when a player wins the game:</p>
<pre><code>Malory won a goal was made - 34</code></pre>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<li>You provide source code and an executable package. Make sure you explicitly declare all your dependencies.</li>
<li>Your AI won't have access to the internet - sorry DeepMind.</li>

<h3 id="scoring-detailed">Scoring detailed</h3>
<p>score = (team_count-position)/(team_count-1)</p>

<ul>
<li>position == score</li>
<li>1 == 90% maximum score</li>
<li>2 == 87%</li>
<li>3 == 84%</li>
<li>4 == 81%</li>
